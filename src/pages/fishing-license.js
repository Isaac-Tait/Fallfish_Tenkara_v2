              <p class="ml-2 mb-4">Obtaining a fishing license (aka hituri ken – 日釣 券 ) in Japan can be easy, as long as you know how to go about acquiring one.</p>
              <p class="ml-2 mb-4">First make sure the river is actually open for fishing. For more information seeing Keiryu Fishing Season.</p>
              <p class="ml-2 mb-4">Next you need to find the place to acquire your hituri ken. Sometimes they are sold at convenience stores other times you buy them from a co-op volunteers home.</p>
              <p class="ml-2 mb-4">Keep your eyes peeled for a yellow flag called yūryōken hanbaisyo (遊漁券 販売所).</p>
              <p class="ml-2 mb-4">Before purchasing a hituri ken you need to make sure it is for the section of the river you want to fish. Often times a river can be “owned” by several co-ops or Fisheries Cooperative Associations (aka 内水面漁業協同組合). For each section of the river you will need to buy a separate hituri ken.</p>
              <p class="ml-2 mb-4">A hituri ken typically cost anywhere from ¥500 – ¥4,400 per person per day and often have a restriction on how many fish you can keep.</p>     
              <p class="ml-2 mb-4">Only rivers that are stocked by Fisheries Cooperative Association require a hituri ken. If you are fishing genryu and keiryu deep in the mountains you typically do not need one.</p>
              <p class="ml-2 mb-4">If you are supposed to have a hituri ken but do not know where to purchase one, do not despair often times you can buy them on the spot when asked by a volunteer.</p>
