<p class="mb-2">Since moving to Japan I had heard a lot about how much fun Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea were. So a week or two back my wife and I visited both parks. The hype was well founded. We started with Tokyo Disneyland on a rainy Monday - Typhoon 19 was making its way towards Japan but thankfully the rain held off till the very end of the day. I was excited to see that Tokyo Disneyland still had the Swiss Family Robinson Tree House and The Grand Circuit Raceway, which were two of my favorite attractions when I was a kid at the Disneyland in Anaheim California.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">I think this duck thought it was part of the show, just strutting her stuff on the parade route (and my cheap [¥2100], fabulous, and huge Japanese dinner at Restaurant Hokusai).</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Later that week we headed over to Tokyo DisneySea. If you find yourself in Tokyo with a day to spare I highly recommend visiting Tokyo DisneySea. This park is unbelievably cool and it is readily apparent that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_DisneySea#Awards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">¥335,000,000,000</a> (billion) it cost to build the park was money well spent.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Both Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea are located next to each other. It costs ¥860 round trip to get to either park by train from the Tokyo Station (including the parks monorail). The tickets are much cheaper than say DisneyWorld in Orland ($105) or DisneyLand in Anaheim ($99) coming in at just $57 per person per day per park! Do note though that there is no special park hopper ticket...</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">And if you find yourself near Tokyo Dome you have to pay the ¥1,050 to ride Thunder Dolphin, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_Dolphin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">the 10th tallest continuous circuit roller coaster in the world</a>. I am not much of a roller coaster guy but I absolutely loved this ride, especially that first drop where you go from 0 to 130kph in a second or so. Here is a video of the ride (it is not mine).</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Between our visits to Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea we also squeezed in a trip to Kyoto (which I will write about soon), a ride on the shinkansen (Japanese bullet train), and a <a href="https://taiken.co/single/baseball-it-is" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">baseball game</a>. In total we walked over 100km in 8 days, which was great conditioning for my 3 day <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/backcountry-tenkara/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">backcountry Tenkara trip</a> that I embarked on immediately after!</p>
