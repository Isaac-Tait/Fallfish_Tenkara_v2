<p class="mb-2">Since moving to Japan I had heard a lot about how much fun Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea were. So a week or two back my wife and I visited both parks. The hype was well founded. We started with Tokyo Disneyland on a rainy Monday - Typhoon 19 was making its way towards Japan but thankfully the rain held off till the very end of the day. I was excited to see that Tokyo Disneyland still had the Swiss Family Robinson Tree House and The Grand Circuit Raceway, which were two of my favorite attractions when I was a kid at the Disneyland in Anaheim California.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">I think this duck thought it was part of the show, just strutting her stuff on the parade route (and my cheap [짜2100], fabulous, and huge Japanese dinner at Restaurant Hokusai).</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Later that week we headed over to Tokyo DisneySea. If you find yourself in Tokyo with a day to spare I highly recommend visiting Tokyo DisneySea. This park is unbelievably cool and it is readily apparent that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_DisneySea#Awards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">짜335,000,000,000</a> (billion) it cost to build the park was money well spent.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Both Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea are located next to each other. It costs 짜860 round trip to get to either park by train from the Tokyo Station (including the parks monorail). The tickets are much cheaper than say DisneyWorld in Orland ($105) or DisneyLand in Anaheim ($99) coming in at just $57 per person per day per park! Do note though that there is no special park hopper ticket...</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">And if you find yourself near Tokyo Dome you have to pay the 짜1,050 to ride Thunder Dolphin, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_Dolphin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">the 10th tallest continuous circuit roller coaster in the world</a>. I am not much of a roller coaster guy but I absolutely loved this ride, especially that first drop where you go from 0 to 130kph in a second or so. Here is a video of the ride (it is not mine).</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Between our visits to Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea we also squeezed in a trip to Kyoto (which I will write about soon), a ride on the shinkansen (Japanese bullet train), and a <a href="https://taiken.co/single/baseball-it-is" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">baseball game</a>. In total we walked over 100km in 8 days, which was great conditioning for my 3 day <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/backcountry-tenkara/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">backcountry Tenkara trip</a> that I embarked on immediately after!</p>
