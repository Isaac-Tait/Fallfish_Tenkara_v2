<p class="mb-2">2016 was a great year with big trips every month of the fishing season and some phenomenal hikes, rock climbs, mountain bike rides, and of course skiing thrown in the mix too. Here are a few of the highlights.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">The New Year was kicked off with the incomparable <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/nozawa-onsen-fire-festival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">Nozawa Onsen Fire Festival</a>. What could possibly be more Japanese then turning a water theme park into a <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/toshimaen-fishing-park/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">fishing resort</a>? I kitted out my kei van with a <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/custom-camper-van/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">swank camper interior</a> that came in quite handy. My friend Junpei and I experienced true <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/yugen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">yugen</a> during a fabulous ski trip to Akita and Iwate Prefectures. Probably my most favorite rock climbing crag in Japan has to be <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/ogawayama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">Ogawayama</a>, and for good reason. I introduced my good friend to Tenkara in the <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/tone-river-headwaters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">headwaters</a> of the Tone River. Then a month later we visited the old stomping grounds of the shokurayosha beneath the shadow of the impressive <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/torikabuto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">Torikabutosan</a>. I discovered a fabulous fishing coop in my backyard at the <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/tanitaro-river/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">TaniTaro River</a>. I pursued the elusive <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/blue-and-white-flycatcher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">Blue and White Flycatcher</a> deep in the Tanzawa Mountains and discovered an ultra-remote stream loaded with ghost Iwana. My wife and I explored Hachijojima and the seldom visited <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/aogashima/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">Aogashima</a> islands a few hundred kilometers off the coast of Japan. My good friend Kado-san and Wan-san and I finished off the fishing season with a bang by camping on the banks of a remote <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/genryu-tenkara/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">genryu</a> deep in Oze National Park. Last, and certainly not least, I had the distinct honor of learning how to make <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/bamboo-tenkara-rod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">bamboo Tenkara rods</a> with Yamano-sensei and Ishii-san.</p>
