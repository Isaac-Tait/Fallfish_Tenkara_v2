<p class="mb-2">Fujigoko (富士五湖), or Fuji Five Lakes in English, is a Japanese national treasure of exquisite and unbelievable beauty. My two favorite lakes are Motosu and Shōji. They are my favorite because the shorelines have not been overrun by hotels, shops, and parking lots like Kawaguchiko, Saiko, and <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/climbing-mount-fuji/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">Yamanakako</a> lakes.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2 font-bold text-red-500 text-center">Nothing lasts forever...</p>
<p class="italic text-center">From the withering grass to the fading flower</p>
<p class="italic text-center">Of their glorious beauty - only a memory of the sensations remains</p>
<p class="italic text-center">Yet fading each day</p>
<p class="italic text-center">The trees of the forest carry on</p>
<p class="italic text-center">Ceaselessly their song of commemoration and wonder</p>
<p class="italic text-center">An instruction carried upon the wind for all to hear</p>
<p class="italic text-center">An indefatigable reminder to seek the true purpose and love that is hidden</p>
<p class="italic text-center">Hidden like a treasure within us all</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">While searching for a view of Mount Fuji unfettered by power lines and radio towers we came across an abandoned Shinto Shrine. The place was eerie with an eldritch vibe. We did not stick around too long.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Pressing on we came across a vista of Lake Motosu and the Southern Japanese Alps - the right most peak (not obscured by the clouds) is Mount Kita - at 3193 meters tall she is the second tallest mountain in Japan, after Mount Fuji.</p>
