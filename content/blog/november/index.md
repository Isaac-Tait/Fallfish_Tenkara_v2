title: November 
description: Typically the hardest month adventure wise for me is November. The ski areas are not yet open and the tenkara fishing season is closed pretty much everywhere. So, I set off on some alternate adventures...

<p class="mb-2">November is a beautiful month in Japan - the fall colors are in full swing, the days are cool the evenings are brisk, and preparations are in full swing for snow. However, the lull between Tenkara season and ski season requires that I get creative to find things to do. Luckily, there is a plethora of outdoor activities to enjoy in Japan.</p>

<p class="text-center font-bold underline">Wakasagi Fishing on Lake Sagamiko</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Wakasagi also known as Smelt is a very popular game fish in Japan. Even though these fish are only a few inches long Wakasagi anglers really get into it with some impressive gear.</p>

<p class="text-center font-bold underline">Mountain Biking</p>
<p class="text-center font-semibold">Izu Peninsula </p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">This area offers some pretty spectacular views of Mt. Fuji, Uchiura Bay, and Suruga Bay. November is the perfect month to come and scope out the area, which is rife with keiryu that you may just find a few Amago living in.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">The Fall colors are amazing this year and Toyohide Waterfall was raging from all the rain. I waded through the water and climbed to the top of the waterfall. I am pretty sure you could find some fun warm water fishing in the area...</p>

I brought one to hand but the camera was in the car. The rest broke the 5x tippet like it was thread.</p>
