<p class="mb-2">Fall is in the air! The lighting is starting to shift and the leaves are starting to turn orange, red, and yellow at the higher elevations. Soon the days will get colder and the snow will begin to fall. However, there are still five weeks left in the trout fishing season here in Japan and I intend to make the most of every day.</p>

<p class="mb-2 mt-2">The last two weeks have been very busy, I have guided and climbed Mount Fuji four times, guided three Tenkara trips, and gone sailing on Tokyo Bay (hence the lack of blog posts recently). Here are a few videos chronicling my guiding adventures so far this summer.</p>

<p class="mb-2 mt-2">It has been a Tenkara summer for the record books and it is still not over yet. Last summer I spent over 60 days fishing the multitude of rivers, streams, and lakes in Maryland. This summer, while my trips have been a little less frequent (because of exorbitant toll road fees), the trips that I have been on have been nothing short of magical. Sometimes I have to pinch myself when I am Tenkara fly fishing a beautiful keiryu or genryu for native Yamame and Iwana, just to make sure I am not dreaming.</p>

<p class="mb-2 mt-2">While this Tenkara season is coming to a close, now is a good time to start planning your own trip to Japan. There are currently several airfare sales, I have seen tickets as low as $650 RT from LA to Tokyo.
