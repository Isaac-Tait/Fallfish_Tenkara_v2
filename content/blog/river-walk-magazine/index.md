<p class="mb-2">At the emphatic suggestion from a good friend of mine I headed up to Yokohama with my son to check out a soup curry restaurant called <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/maps/place/KIKUYA%E3%83%BBCURRY/@35.4491728,139.6220584,16z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x60185c8a6564cbad:0xf73a4dd61507cb69!2sHinodecho+Station!8m2!3d35.445521!4d139.6266812!3m4!1s0x0:0x99caf2855e1fdaa8!8m2!3d35.4484609!4d139.6270104?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">Kikuya ∙ Curry</a>. The restaurant is located within walking distance from both the Hinodecho Station and the Sakuragicho Station. The restaurant is small seating only 17 people, but their friendly service and absolutely delicious curry make this place worth the wait even if there is a line. I personally do not like to stand in lines with an infant in 90% humidity so I went after the lunch rush and was seated immediately. I ordered the potato chicken curry medium spicy with a large rice. It was absolutely delicious. Next time I think I will try the potato and cheese dish, which is my friends favorite.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Unfortunately, I did not get any photos of my food because they do not have high chairs -  my hands were too full holding a squirming six month old to take any (there are plenty of food porn photos at the Tablelog page <a href="https://tabelog.com/en/kanagawa/A1401/A140102/14004143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">here</a> though). After lunch we stopped in at the beautiful <a href="https://www.iseyama.jp" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">Iseyamakōtai Jingū Shrine (伊勢山皇大神宮)</a> before heading over to the<a href="https://colettemare-yokohama.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white"> Colette ∙ Mare</a> shopping mall to find a baby changing room.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">While I was browsing through the mall I came across a <a href="https://colettemare-yokohama.com/shop/874" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">Kinokuniya</a> bookstore that had an extensive collection of Japanese trekking and fishing books and magazines. One title jumped out to me immediately "River Walk - First Issue" I picked it up and immediately knew I had to purchase a copy.</p>

It is not a fly fishing only magazine though as it incorporates all disciplines of mountain stream fishing found in Japan. The photography is exceptional and there were several artwork pieces too, which I found very engaging.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">There were several interesting articles including one about Chichibu's (秩父) Iwana (Chichibu's mountains streams are a mecca for mountain stream fishing that is very close to Tokyo). There was some great photography from a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/420827871266964/permalink/1746457212037350/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">river snorkeler</a>. As well as a cool feature of a young pyrography artist whose medium is drift wood found on mountain streams. And of course there is enough fishing photos to make anyone want to buy a plane ticket to Japan immediately.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">River Walk also maintains a <a href="https://river-walk.co.jp" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">website</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/teru.wakabayashi.7" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">Facebook</a> page, and <a href="https://twitter.com/WakabayashiWalk?lang=ja" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">Twitter</a> profile.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">The first issue was published on September 30, 2016. The second issue should be hitting the shelves this summer; I am excited to see what content, artwork, and photography the next issue will feature. You can purchase your own copy of Issue One on Amazon Japan <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/RIVER-WALK-First-Issue/dp/4990915909/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1501041702&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=river+walk" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">here</a>.</p>
