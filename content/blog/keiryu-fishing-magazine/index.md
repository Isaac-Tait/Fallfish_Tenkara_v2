<p class="mb-2">I for one thoroughly enjoy every issue of the Japanese Keiryu (a.k.a. Mountain Stream) Magazine. Even though I cannot understand most of what is written (Google Translate only gets one so far) I am enthralled by the photography - and the maps. I am always interested to see where exactly these magical streams are that are featured in every issue. However, tracking down these genryu and keiryu can be a very daunting task. Sometimes I will spend an hour pouring over Google Maps searching for where they might be located, others pop right up on the first search.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Well I have compiled my research in one place - I even color coded it by issue for easy reference. I have not track down every single genryu and keiryu listed yet though and I am missing a few issues (a problem that Amazon JP is helping me remedy). My goal in taking on this project has been to help those planning a visit to Japan with some initial research. If, for example you know you will be traveling around Matsumoto in Nagano Prefecture you can see what issue (or issues) of the Keiryu (Mountain Stream) Magazine featured river in that area. This should help prepare you as far as gear needs dictated by terrain - as well as seasonal requirements and even fishing permit information. Just another step in the direction in helping angling foreigners planning a visit to Japan.</p>
