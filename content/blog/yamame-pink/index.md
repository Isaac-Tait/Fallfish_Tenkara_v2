<p class="mb-2">Today is a short post to to share the work of a talented artist that I recently discovered named Yasunari Murakami. Like many of the good things I have discovered, I came across Murakami-san's artwork via Twitter (thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/WakabayashiWalk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">@WakabayashiWalk</a>).</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Mr. Murakami-san was born in 1955 in Gifu Prefecture. He is the author of the famous book series titled "Yamame Pink" (ヤマメのピンクシリーズ), which I have purchased a copy of for my son. Over the years his artwork has won him many awards.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">While I have never met Murakami-san, I enjoy his style of art, which has a decidedly Japanese vibe to it. He has a <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/maps/place/Murakamiyasunari+Museum/@34.914015,139.106392,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6019c34f6c172685:0x1c95d290d6f4217e!8m2!3d34.914015!4d139.108586?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gallery</a> in Shizuoka, if you are in the area stop by. I purchased a few items, which I plan to decorate my man cave with. Mr. Murakami-san personifies many fish species, some of which are not native to Japan - for example the California state fish the Golden Trout (soon to be new home).</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Mr. Yasunari Murakami-san has a <a href="http://www.murakami-museum.co.jp/murakami_tuhan/tuhan.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">web store</a> too but I am not sure if he ships outside of Japan. He can be reached by email at <a href="mailto:izu@murakami-museum.co.jp">izu@murakami-museum.co.jp</a>.</p>
