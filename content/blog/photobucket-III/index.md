<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Note: Godzilla first made landfall on mainland Japan in 1954 at Kannonzaki Cape on Miura Peninsula. His first footprints have been forever immortalized (in 1/10th scale) near a small sandy beach frequented by sea gulls and fishermen.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2 font-bold">Musings</p>
<p class="mt-2 mb-2">This, the third installment of my photobucket series is a hodgepodge collage of random photos from my adventures in Japan. It has been a while since my last substantial blog post but I have been keeping busy doing some under the hood tuning of the backend of Fallfish Tenkara. To name a few of the things that have been taking up a lot of my time lately: HTTP/2, DNS, CDN, caches, themes, JS, CSS, Apache, droplets, VPS, SSH, SFTP, permissions, WP, and AWS.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">In other news the Sierra Nevada is getting hammered with <a href="https://unofficialalpine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">storm after storm</a>, which is good because California really needs the water. Of course I am a little jealous, winter is just getting started here in Japan (at least Honshu Island - Hokkaido has been absolutely slammed with snow in the last month or so). I will be headed up to Hokkaido for the Sapporo Snow Festival in February - I am looking forward to that trip.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Also, in case you missed it (and read this far) the latest issue of Tenkara Angler published on December 1. Yours truly wrote a piece titled "The Theology of Tenkara, Trout, and Japan". Check it out!
