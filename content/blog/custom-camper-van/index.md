<p class="mb-2">It has been a busy month! Before heading up to <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/rivers-of-hokkaido/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hokkaido</a> for the <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/sapporo-snow-festival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sapporo Snow Festival</a> and the <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/otaru-light-festival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Otaru Light Festival</a>; and between ski trips to Shiga Kogen, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.455240918013301.1073741831.355562167981177&amp;type=1&amp;l=c000eccd9f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hiking around the Miura Hills</a>, and planning a ski road trip to Akita and Iwate Prefectures I have been doing some work to build my very own custom camper microvan.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Last summer I purchased a 1995 Daihatsu Atrai <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/japanese-kei-cars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kei car</a>, which for me this is a perfect vehicle. However, storing gear for Tenkara and skiing adventures quickly filled up the interior. So I began to brainstorm ideas to maximize the interior space while not detracting from the driveability and low key nature of the vehicle.</p>

<img class="w-8/12 rounded-lg shadow-lg mx-auto" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mountaintopcoding-127956/image/upload/v1652024244/Fallfish%20Tenkara/camper-van/camper_van-kei_van-custom_interior-van_life-tenkara_bum-ski_bum-japow_pzpjmd.jpg" alt="sourcing material" />

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">First I assembled the necessary materials from Homes (which is quite possibly one of the most amazing stores in the world! Imagine if Ikea, Home Depot, WalMart, Crate &amp; Barrel, and Sport Chalet were combined into one store - and you would have a pretty good idea what Homes is).</p>

<img class="w-8/12 rounded-lg shadow-lg mx-auto" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mountaintopcoding-127956/image/upload/v1652024244/Fallfish%20Tenkara/camper-van/camper_van-kei_van-custom_interior-van_life-tenkara_bum-ski_bum-japow-plywood_vjw5jx.jpg" alt="pre-COVID prices" />

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Next I compiled measurements and layout composites to ensure that everything was going to fit and line up - my motto is "Measure twice (maybe three times) and cut once."</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">I have access to a wood hobby shop that has pretty much every tool you could imagine.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Then over two days (I miscalculated my material needs and had to make another run to Homes) I created the first components of my camper interior.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">And here is the (mostly) finished creation! I built it as two modules to make it easier to remove them (and because the battery compartment is under the non-factory carpet).</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">The next phase is building a removable headboard to protect the back window, adding a mattress/foam, and adding in removable bike mounts so that I can transport a bike which I frequently use to access remote backcountry rivers like the one in the video below.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2 text-center italic text-sm">And here is a video I recently created.</p>
