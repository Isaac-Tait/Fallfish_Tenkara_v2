<p class="mb-2">Mount Fuji (12,839' or 3,776m) is one of the most iconic mountains in the world. The summit is only 100km from the largest city in the world, Tokyo - and only 25km from the ocean! This makes Mount Fuji not only geographically prominent but culturally prominent as well. Every year over a quarter million people climb Mount Fuji and roughly a third of those people are foreigners. Do keep in mind that these numbers are only tallied during the official climbing season, which is from early July to mid-September. People climb Mount Fuji throughout the year so the actual number of people climbing to the summit is much much higher. This week I joined the "madness" and climbed Mount Fuji.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Since it is still early in the official climbing season I could only go as far as the 10th station, which is located on the rim of the summit crater. The Ohachi-meguri Trail (the Crater Rim Trail), which takes one to the true summit from the 10th Station, was closed due to snow, high winds, and fog. I was stopped 56 meters in elevation and roughly 1.5km in distance from the actual summit! Still it was a splendid hike and on the way up the weather was clear, the sun even tried to come out a few times. The views were unbeatable!</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">As I neared the summit crater though the winds began to pick up. More than once I was blown over by the winds and in particularly strong gusts the volcanic ash was blasted into my face and hands, which was quite painful. Since I was climbing Mount Fuji early in the climbing season, and during a <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/plum-rain/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">particularly wet monsoon season</a>, I was expecting the weather to not cooperate. August and early September is supposed to be the best months to climb Mount Fuji weather wise.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">When I reached the 10th Station the temperatures plummeted and it began to snow! I took shelter inside of the 10th Station Hut and ordered up some hot tea. They also serve hot food and even beer, the prices are reasonable too!</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">After warming up in the hut and putting on all my rain gear I began making my way down the mountain. About halfway down my rain gear gave up keeping the driving rain out. The fog was incredibly thick, all the nice views I enjoyed on the way up were gone. I was left to my thoughts as I made my way down the incredibly steep descent trail.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">After a bone jarring 100+ switchbacks I welcomed the few short uphill sections on the traverse back to the Fuji Subaru 5th Station. Safely back at the 5th station, having been hiking for 11+ hours, I passed out on the bus ride back home - waking only long enough to eat quite possibly the best meal I have ever had!</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">There is tons of information out there on climbing and summiting Mount Fuji via one of its four trails, but I found these two sites to have the most current and gaijin friendly information.</p>
