<p class="mb-2 mt-2">After a full day of fishing and some exciting Japanese mountain driving we arrived at Hikawa Camping Grounds. It is absolutely beautiful here and we practically have the entire place to ourselves! The cherry blossoms are going off, the birds are singing, and the fish are rising. It does not get any better than this.</p>
