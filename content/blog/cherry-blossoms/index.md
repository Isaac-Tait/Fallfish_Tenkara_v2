<p class="mb-2">It is that time of the year where the cherry blossoms bloom create a cloudscape of pink, white, and red that smothers a landscape that only a few short weeks prior was barren and grey. The advent of warm days and pleasant evenings bring the people out in droves, all of whom are grateful for the respite from winter's chill. As the trees come to life it hints that in the mountains high above the snow is beginning to melt engorging the rivers. The swelling of the keiryu and genryu is a sign to the inhabitants that the spawn is over and the feast is set to begin.</p>



<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Timing a visit to Japan to see the Cherry Blossoms is always a bit of risk. While they happen every year being there at the peak is a bit of gamble. With this years mild winter the blossoms came a little early. It just so happens that this was the week our friends from the States had been planning on visiting for nearly a year. Here are a few of the highlights from Tait's Tokyo Tours (not a real entity - but the name does have a nice ring to it...).</p>
