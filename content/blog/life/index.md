<div class="text-lg mt-2">
<p class="mb-2">When I was younger I had no concept of time, I thought I would be young forever. My first real realization of time came when I was 17 and I joined the US Marine Corps. Suddenly, as I was standing on those <a href="https://terminallance.com/2015/08/11/terminal-lance-394-cant-stop-time-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">yellow footprints</a>, I realized:</p>

<p class="italic mt-2 mb-2">"13 weeks is a long time!"</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">As my drill instructor was screaming in my face with his knife hand quivering a hairs breadth (this is the PC term btw) from my nose I thanked my God that they could do anything they wanted to me <span class="underline;">but</span> stop the clock.

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">That was 16+ years ago now. The clock never stops ticking and all good things (and bad things too) must all come to an end.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">On November 13, 2014 I caught my first glimpse of Japan from the plane's window. As I looked down on the Ibaraki coast line I thought to myself:

<p class="italic mt-2 mb-2">"Three years is a long time!"</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Well, three years was more like 3 1/2 years - but, the clock kept ticking and now I too have closed the Japan chapter in my life. Of course I will go to Japan again, but I will be a tourist then and not a resident. Not to say that there is anything wrong with that... Just that it will be different - I really will miss saying "I live in Japan!"</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">After I had lived in Japan for year or so the novelty was replaced with familiarity. Since then I have always been a little envious of people who have just arrived in Japan for the first time. For them everything in Japan is foreign, wonderful, amazing, unbelievable, otherworldly.</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Jonathan Antunez said it best:</p>

<p class="italic mt-2 mb-2">"Japan is the closest you can get to another world without leaving earth. I loved every minute."</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">I too love Japan - and I loved every minute I was there. All one million seven hundred and sixty one thousand one hundred and twenty minutes of it (give or take a few minutes...).</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2 italic">As they say:"You can take the man out of the Corps, but you cannot take the Corps out of the man." </p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">I feel the same rings true for me and Japan:</p>

<p class="italic mt-2 mb-2">"You can take the man out of Japan, but you cannot take Japan out of the man."</p>

<p class="w-1/4 mx-auto text-sm italic mb-4">The first photo ever published on Fallfish Tenkara</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">I will stop waxing nostalgic and reminiscing now, because yes I will miss Japan and my friends there, but I am now beginning a new chapter. Since I published the <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/fishing-uratanzawa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">first blog post</a> on Fallfish Tenkara on January 20, 2015 I have aimed at making it a resource for those interested in Japan and Japanese tenkara. However, my desire to keep writing about fishing and tenkara has not abated - so in an effort to keep Fallfish Tenkara all about Japan I have launched a new site called <a href="https://www.cutthroattenkara.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">Cutthroat Tenkara</a>.</p>

<img class="w-8/12 rounded-lg shadow-lg mx-auto" src="https://fallfish-tenkara-images.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/FfT+-+Life/CtT-Cutthroat+Tenkara-A+western+tenkara+adventure.jpg" alt="Cutthroat Tenkara Logo" />

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Cutthroat Tenkara will be for my continuing tenkara adventures in the US and anywhere else but Japan. I would love to keep adding cool Japan content to Fallfish Tenkara though, so if you have (or recently had) a trip to the Land of the Rising Sun and would like to write a guest post please let me know - if it is real good I may even consider paying for exclusive rights (please see <a href="https://www.fallfishtenkara.com/guest-blogging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white">this</a> page for more info on submitting guest trip reports from Japan to Fallfish Tenkara).</p>

<p class="mt-2 mb-2">Cutthroat Tenkara is still a little rough around the edges, but what is not rough is the logo (a huge shout out to my friend <a href="https://www.forman.farm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-red-500 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white"">Charles Forman</a> who designed both the Fallfish Tenkara logo and both of the Cutthroat Tenkara logos). I dig the new Cutthroat Tenkara logo so much I have decided to do a limited edition sticker release 100% free (for the first 50 people). Shoot me an email using the contact form below with your mailing address and I will get a free sticker in the mail to you asap (please allow a few weeks for delivery). Once this batch is gone, that is it though and it is first come first served...</p>
